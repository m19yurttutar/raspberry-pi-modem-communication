# Project Progress Report - Week 1

## Tasks Accomplished

### Learning Basic Git Commands

During this week, I delved into the essentials of Git commands, focusing on fundamental operations like `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`. This included setting up a collaborative repository on GitHub, providing a centralized space for project files and version control.

### Creating Documents using Markdown

I dedicated time to mastering the Markdown language, exploring its nuances and functionalities. This encompassed formatting techniques for text, headers, lists, links, and incorporating images within documents for enhanced readability and structure.

### Raspberry Pi 3B+ Setup and Basic Bash Commands

A significant portion of the week was devoted to setting up the Raspberry Pi 3B+ with its operating system. Additionally, I familiarized myself with foundational bash commands, particularly focusing on file management and navigation within the system.

### Project Planning

A crucial aspect of the week involved meticulous planning. I crafted a comprehensive 6-week project plan, breaking down tasks into manageable weekly chunks and establishing a clear timeline to ensure timely progress and goal attainment.

### Preparation of Gantt Chart

To visually map out the project's trajectory, I created a Gantt chart. This visual aid aids in the clear visualization of tasks, milestones, and dependencies, providing an effective roadmap for project execution. The chart was uploaded to GitHub for easy accessibility and reference.

## Challenges Faced

While progress was notable, challenges arose, particularly in configuring the Raspberry Pi. However, these hurdles were overcome through thorough research, experimentation, and leveraging online resources and documentation.

## Next Steps

Moving forward, the focus will shift towards the implementation phase. This includes leveraging the Git workflow for collaborative development, conducting experiments on the Raspberry Pi for modem communication, and iterating through the planned tasks as per the outlined timeline.
